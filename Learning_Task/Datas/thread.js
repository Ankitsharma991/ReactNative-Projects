    title3: `It's great you like this app, there will lot more interesting features are coming. Hope you guys will enjoy and go further in learning process.`,

    thread1: `What after the many implementations? If I keep on implementing 5+5=10 in various scenarios, it would lead to various other learnings. Now, would that ultimately in some way have any effect on the original learning of 5+5=10? Does a concept or an idea get developed or evolved as we keep putting those ideas in various scenarios using various methods of implementation? (I hope the question makes sense, am just thinking out loud.) ||Or does the idea always remain the same? Would 5+5 be ALWAYS equal to 10? Who or what determines that? `,
    thread2: `Text eclipse is working fine I guess but not sure what you did why letter spacing is gayab ||Both the bugs are fixed now code is pushed `,
    thread3: `The app looks so good. Thank you and congrats @Shagun + all who worked on it 👏`,
